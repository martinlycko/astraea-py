📍Cardiff, London or Remote (UK) | 💰 £55,000 - £95,000 + Benefits | Technology - Credit & Data ✨

⭐Monzo’s Borrowing Credit & Data team

Our Borrowing Credit & Data team is the largest and most diverse team within Monzo’s Data Discipline, and is also one of the largest parts of the Borrowing Collective.

This team sits at the core of our lending business. We design products, decide who to lend to, set underwriting policy, track the volume of new originations, identify customers who need help, manage the portfolio, measure risk and compute the core metrics required both for Monzo’s senior management and for our external financial reporting. We set prices, build predictive models, run experiments, build dashboards, enhance data pipelines and manage Monzo’s credit risk.

Our Data team's mission is to Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

We are scaling up our Capital, Impairment and Forecasting modelling team to support the rapid growth and evolution of our portfolio. This role is pivotal for the team as the successful candidate will develop and further enhance our suite of IFRS 9 models (PD, LGD, EAD, macroeconomic models) across both well established and emerging products. Additionally the successful individual will have oversight of model performance, construction of PMAs/model overlays where required, and will have regular interaction with the senior management.

Strong data and analytical skills are a must, as is a deep expertise in credit risk modelling and IFRS 9 provision methodology. Experience in stress testing, IRB modelling, retail credit originations, Net Present Value modelling, Scorecard modelling and Capital are desirable, but not essential.

🔑You’ll play a key role by...

End-to-end development and maintenance of IFRS 9 models (PD, EAD, LGD)
Construction of post-model adjustments / model overlays as and when required
Implementation of new models 
Development and maintenance of economic-response models for scenario simulation and impairment 
Oversight and enhancement of model monitoring
Presenting modelling results to 1LOD and 2LOD risk forums/committees, senior management and Execs
Review and challenge a wider range of modelling solutions across the Borrowing collective (including IFRS 9, NPV, pricing etc.)
Close collaboration with portfolio strategy, model validation, finance and external audit teams

🤩We’d love to hear from you if…

You have a strong background in IFRS 9 impairments
You have strong end to end experience in the development and implementation of credit models (e.g PD, LGD, EAD). Experience in a validation or monitoring setting is also well regarded
You have strong experience in monitoring ECLs and conducting driver analyses 
You have strong analytical skills and a track record of using these to deliver technical projects
You have a solid technical toolkit. SQL and either Python or R is a must-have, a data visualisation tool (such as Tableau, PowerBI, Looker) is a plus
You can convey problems and solutions using clear and simple language, both written and verbal (see Monzo’s tone of voice guide). This is particularly important for communicating complex issues and priorities to non-experts
You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, our products, our users and your team-mates
You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on

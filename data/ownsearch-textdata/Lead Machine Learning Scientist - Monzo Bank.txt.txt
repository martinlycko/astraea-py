⭐ About Operations

The challenges are significant: we aim to transform customer service by reducing the time and effort required to resolve issues, enhancing customer confidence and satisfaction. As part of Operations you’ll be at the forefront of our mission to provide unparalleled customer support experiences. Your role will be pivotal in leveraging state of the art machine learning techniques including LLMs to understand customer problems, to develop an effective human-in-the loop system that augments automation with the efforts of support workforce (who we call COps) to more expediently and efficiently predict, identify, disambiguate and route customer problems at scale to support a rapidly expanding company with global ambitions across multiple geographies.

You’ll be one of 4 ML engineers in Operations, embedded in product squads working alongside data scientists, backend, mobile and web engineers, product managers, user researchers, designers and operations specialists

You'll Play a Key Role By

We’ll be expecting you to leverage your deep experience of developing and deploying advanced Machine Learning models to:

Understand customers’ problems and support needs based on a variety of inputs.
Route customers to the right COp who can support them and globally optimise those routing decisions across millions of customers and thousands of support staff.
Automate the resolution of customers’ support needs through autonomous agents.
Aid customer support in decision-making and pattern detection.

The technical approaches you take to solve these problems will be very much in your hands and we’ll strongly encourage and support experimentation and innovation. We’ll be expecting you to justify and demonstrate effectiveness along the way, making sure the approach meets our business and customer needs.

You Should Apply If

What we’re doing here at Monzo excites you!

You have a track record of leading the technical work of a team in the development and deployment of advanced Machine Learning models tackling real business problems with demonstrable impact, preferably in a fast moving tech company.
You have experience developing and shipping deep learning, graph-based, and/or sequence-based ML architectures to production and delivering business impact.
You're impact driven and excited to own the end to end journey that starts with a business problem and ends with your solution having a measurable impact in production.
You have experience in, and a passion for, mentoring other ML practitioners, sharing knowledge and raising the technical bar across the team.

Using advanced machine learning techniques to directly improve customer support experiences and globally optimise routing and prioritisation across millions of customers and thousands of support staff sounds exciting to you.
You have extensive experience writing production Python code and a strong command of SQL. You are comfortable using them every day, and keen to learn Go lang which is used in many of our backend microservices. 
You thrive working on ambiguous problems and have a track record of helping your team and stakeholders resolve that ambiguity.
You want to be involved in building a product that you and the people you know use every day, with a product mindset that prioritises customer outcomes and data-informed decisions.
You're excited about fast-moving developments in Machine Learning and can communicate those ideas to colleagues who are not familiar with the domain.
You’re adaptable, curious and enjoy learning new technologies and ideas.

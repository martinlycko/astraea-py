• Support the development, interpretation and use of control frameworks, KPIs, Operational Service Levels and Critical Success Factors which describe what success looks like.

• Support the development of MI reports and dashboards with clear visuals, ensuring they continue to serve customers’ needs and support management decision making.

• Provide strategic analysis to assist in achieving strategic objectives.

• Maintain documentation of work requests received using DevOps, and store and maintain analytical code using Git, making improvements to code where applicable.

• Provide peer review and QA of work produced by team colleagues, and regularly share knowledge across the team.

• Identify, monitor and raise opportunities to improve data quality and data sharing.

• Provide subject matter expertise on data held across the directorate.

• Support the building and updating of forecast models, with maintenance of associated documentation.

• Assist with answering Freedom of Information requests and with the external publication of information as official statistics.

• Be a contributing and proactive member of the Regulatory Compliance directorate and the TPR analyst community.

• Contribute to the vision of moving to an automated self-service model for stakeholders.

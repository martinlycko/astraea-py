⭐About Us

Our Mission in Borrowing is to enable people's financial goals through better borrowing. Our customers look to borrow money to enable them to achieve something in their lives - whether that’s making a big life event affordable, buying something they need now without affecting their monthly budget, or getting by until payday. And we’re looking to shape this mission by building products that our customers love, whilst scaling those top revenue lines across the business safely.

Data is crucial to the success of this mission and Borrowing Analytics Engineers are at the core of how we build, scale and re-architect our Borrowing Data Warehouse to enable Monzo to make better decisions, faster, and help serve Monzo’s customers better.

Our Analytics Engineering discipline works in the intersection between data, engineering and our collectives - Money, Borrowing, Operations and Financial Crime and beyond.

The AE teams are responsible for building downstream data models from backend services with the desire to make our Data Warehouse a genuine competitive advantage for Monzo. We want a discipline capable of building a reliable and scalable Data Warehouse to support decision making in a cost effective and performant manner.

Managers within Data have two primary responsibilities; people and technical product. Your focus will be on helping engineers with their personal and professional development, listening and guiding them through hard times and celebrating their successes. You will also be leading and participating directly in technical initiatives and helping Monzo shape its Data organisation, ensuring the team focuses on valuable work, shipping things with a level of care and attention to detail.

There will be a strong focus on delivering best practice across all of our data discipline and helping bring a new level of maturity around Data Governance principles, working in collaboration with others to deliver this.

⭐Monzo’s Borrowing Credit & Data team

Our Borrowing Credit & Data team is the largest and most diverse team within Monzo’s Data Discipline, and is also one of the largest parts of the Borrowing Collective.

This team sits at the core of our lending business. We design products, decide who to lend to, set underwriting policy, track the volume of new originations, identify customers who need help, manage the portfolio, measure risk and compute the core metrics required both for Monzo’s senior management and for our external financial reporting. We set prices, build predictive models, run experiments, build dashboards, enhance data pipelines and manage Monzo’s credit risk.

Our Data team's mission is to Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

We are scaling up our Capital, Impairment and Forecasting modelling team to support the rapid growth and evolution of our portfolio. This role is pivotal for the team as the successful candidate will build up our forecasting capabilities and tools and will have significant exposure to critical business processes such as budgeting & ICAAP.

Leading projects, covering: development, implementation and maintenance of Stress Testing and Forecasting models
Leading business critical processes such as ICAAP and Budgeting, including presenting results to 2LOD, senior management and Execs 
Developing the next generation of performance tracking and analytics toolbox. These would include short horizon forecasting, root cause analysis, ECL decomposition, SICR efficiency.

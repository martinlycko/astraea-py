Your new company

Landmarc provides the support services that enable Armed Forces from around the world to prepare for frontline military operations across the UK Defence Training Estate (DTE). This includes maintaining and delivering safe and sustainable infrastructure, managing and operating training areas and ranges and delivering multi-million pound projects to improve vital training assets.



By joining Landmarc you will be supporting a vision to provide the best training experience for our Armed Forces. They are the first and only Special Purpose Vehicle to be contracted by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) as their Industry Partner on the UK Defence Training Estate and the only company that is solely dedicated to the UK DTE, delivering essential support services since 2003.





Landmarc is a joint venture of Mitie, the UKâ€™s leading facilities management and professional services company and Amentum, a leading provider of global mission services to the U.S. Government.



Last year saw Landmarc sign a new 10-year contract with the MOD which has provided the opportunity and platform to embark on a significant Digital Transformation programme.





The digital transformation programme is designed to revolutionise operations by resetting the technology requirements to ensure that Landmarc is well-placed to deliver maximum value on the new contract term. By leveraging advanced data and reporting tools, the programme aims to enhance performance and efficiency across all departments, digitising operations to streamline processes and reduce manual workloads, complimented by introducing some new leadership roles to refresh and bring in innovative perspectives.





Landmarc is committed to doing things differently, fostering a culture of innovation that prioritises customer and user focus and delivers technology quickly and efficiently.

Looking to make a meaningful impact? Weâ€™re hiring a Data Analyst for a dynamic, data-driven startup on a mission to decarbonise the grid and advance electrification. Based in London with a hybrid model (2/3x per week), this team is pushing the boundaries of energy innovation.



Backed by over $10M in funding, you'll work closely with our co-founders and a dedicated team of 8 engineers and scientists, plus 2 business ops, to drive our platform's growth and scalability.



You will utilise your knowledge in SQL and Python (not essential), to manage and automate data workflows, and automate the team's core business processes!

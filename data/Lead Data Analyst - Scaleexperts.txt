We are partnered with a Data & Analytics SAAS business who operate solely in the Media & TV viewing space.



They have recently built a brand new product for these industries that allows them to fuse together extremely large disparate data sets (TV and radio for example), which they are now scaling out.



Therefore they are looking for a Senior/Lead Analyst to take a lead role at the intersection of analytics and engineering, in order to take this platform much further (the platform itself has a number of Fortran components). As well as being heavily involved in a bunch of special projects that emerge from across the media/TV sector (think of the big players)



Key Skills:



SQL and Python skills for data analysis and manipulation, as well as some engineering experience.
Fortran experience from education/research background
Any experience in media/TV would be beneficial


Interview Process:



1st stage - VC with CTO

2nd stage - F2F panel interview, ideally able to provide examples of relevant code or detailed analysis work/projects to facilitate a discussion



Location: London - Hybrid - 3 days in office (Can be flexible)

Salary: £70,000 - £80,000 base + 20% bonus



Expected Start Date: January (can be flexible)

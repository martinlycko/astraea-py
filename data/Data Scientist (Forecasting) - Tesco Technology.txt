At Tesco, we believe in the power of spending more time together, face to face, than apart. So, during your working week, you can expect to spend 60% of your time in one of our office locations or local sites and the rest remotely. We also recognise that life looks a little different for each of us. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else. That’s why at Tesco, we always welcome a conversation about flexible working. So, talk to us throughout your application about how we can support.





Due to team growth we have an exciting opportunity for an experienced Data Scientist or Senior Data Scientist with either forecasting or strong statistical, probabilistic or time series modelling experience to join our team!

At Tesco, our Data Science team focuses on modelling sophisticated business problems and deploying data products at scale. Our work spans across multiple areas including physical stores, online, supply chain, marketing and Clubcard, where we encourage rotation amongst our colleagues, so they can gain expertise in different subjects. Our team members are encouraged to allocate working hours for learning and personal development every week and are provided with multiple learning resources and tools. Multiple academic collaborations enrich the team expertise; knowledge-sharing events are regular. Furthermore, we have a phenomenal work-life balance, team days, opportunities to attend and speak at conferences and a relaxed but very engaging culture.
